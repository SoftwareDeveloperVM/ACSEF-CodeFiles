*Quantitative Analysis of Adaptogenic and Anxiolytic Nootropicsâ€™ Effects on Zebrafish Cognition Levels*

The analysis below is based upon computational methods outlined in this codebase, with the software for each model being found in different folders and files above. In essence, the study's focus was around the effect of nootropics on fish, and how that would realte to human performence.

**L-Theanine**
``L-Theanine.py``

Individual molecule for L-Theanine, which is a commonly utilized nootropic for enhancing cognitive performence.

**Rhodiola** ``Rhodiola.py``

This was the secondary drug studied throughout the research, with eventually finding little correlation between the drug and enhanced health benifits. 

### Chemical Models
This is a model demonstrated how three different drugs that are studied within this research paper, are predicted to affect human and fish behavior. It outlines the binding affinity between different molecules, and properties of each molecule, and how it relates to the study.
